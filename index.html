                     <b>Come, lets take a photo together!” Lisa already takes her phone out of her pocket. “I can take the image if you want?” I suggest. <br>
                     &emsp;“No, you need to be in it too!”<br>
                     “But I don’t really want to be in the photo…”<br>
                     &emsp;“Why do you not want to be in the photo?”<br>
                     “Its just that I don’t really like selfies…”<br>
                     &emsp;“What is wrong with a selfie?”<br>
                     “I… I don’t really know, it just feels stupid, I guess…”</span><br><br>

						 &emsp;I ended up still taking the selfie. It was a nice picture, which I probably already deleted, I don’t even know anymore. The conversation though never left my mind. What is it about selfies that makes me not want to take one in our selfie-culture today? Is it the act that makes me uncomfortable? It is the way selfies are seen in our contemporary society? Am I afraid to be called narcissistic? What is a selfie in the first place?
						 <br><br><br>

						<h1 id="C2">What is a selfie?</h1><br>
						Selfies are, according to The Oxford Dictionary, “A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.” <img data-src="images/1.jpg" /> Selfies are not just photographs of oneself, sharing this photograph is what it is also about. For others to see it. It’s an invitation to others to like or dislike what you made and to participate in a visual conversation. There is many different platforms where these photos can be shown, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook etc. On Instagram there are, right now, 366,114,169 photos posted with the hashtag selfie.<sup>1</sup> According to 2016 data released by Google shows that there have been 24 billion selfies uploaded in the past few years, and that is just Google Photos, not counting pictures shared on other social media sites. It would take a person 424 years to swipe through that many photos. Psychoanalyst Elsa Godart estimated that young adults will probably take around 25,700 selfies in their lifetime!
						<br><br><br>

						<h1 id="C3">New/old?</h1><br>
						Selfies are often seen as something new, something from these times, but is it? Are selfies something new? The word selfie is rather new. Evidence on the Oxford English Corpus shows the earliest usage of the word selfie in 2002. It was used in an online source on an Australian internet forum. 2002 ABC Online (forum posting) 13 September: “Um, drunk at a mates 21st, I tripped ofer [sic] and landed lip first (with front teeth coming a very close second) on a set of steps. I had a hole about 1 cm long right through my bottom lip. And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie.”  But how about the act? Think about self-portraits for instance. <img data-src="images/2.jpg" /> People have been producing them for centuries, with the medium and publication format changing. Although self-portraits have been made since the earliest times, it is not until the Early Renaissance in the mid-15th century that artists can be frequently identifies depicting themselves as either the main subject, or as important characters in their work. The portrait of a Man in a Turban by Jan van Eyck made in 1433 may well be the earliest known panel self-portrait. Self-portraiture is far less spontaneous and casual than a selfie is. The new genre isn’t dominated by artists, but by amateurs. The selfie is a striking example of how once elite pursuits have become a global visual culture. At one time, self-portraits were the preserve of a highly skilled few. Now anyone with a phone camera can make one. So, we can say selfies are in fact something new. The selfie resonates not because it is new, but because it expresses, develops, expands and intensifies the long history of the self-portrait.<br>
							 &emsp;By the end of the decade, Google envisages 5 billion people on the internet. This is not just another form of mass media. It is the first universal medium. One of the most notable uses of the global network is to create, send and view images of all kinds, from photographs to video, comics, art and animation. The numbers are overwhelming: one hundred hours of YouTube video are uploaded every minute! Every two minutes, Americans alone take more photographs than were made in the entire nineteenth century. In 1930, one billion photographs were being taken every year worldwide. By 2012, we were taking 380 billion photographs a year. Like it or not, the emerging global society is visual. All these photographs and videos are our way of expressing ourselves and understanding the world around us. We feel compelled to make images and share them with others, as a key part of our effort to understand the changing world around us and our place within it.<br><br>

						<h1 id="C4">Narcissism</h1><br>
						Know Thyself, the most important shrine in ancient Greece. The Greeks well understood that lack of self-knowledge is one of the mainsprings of human stupidity and folly. As Socrates would describe it: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” Testing out different possible variations of the self is very much present in today’s digital selfies as well. Perhaps the reason we feel the need to take another selfie is that we never seem able to create a photo that will completely correspond to that you want to see in yourself. But when does to much examination become a bad thing? Selfies are often described as something selfish and narcissistic. The first thing that comes to my mind when hearing the word narcissistic is the Greek mythology, Narcissus. He was a hunter, son of the river god Cephissus and the nymph Liriope. He was a very beautiful young man, and many fell in love with him. However, he only showed them disdain and contempt. One day, while hunting in the woods, the Oread nymph Echo spotted hum and immediately fell for him. When Narcissus sensed that someone was following him, Echo revealed herself and tried to hug him. However, he pushed her off and told her not to disturb him. Echo roamed around the woods for the rest of her life, and wilted away until all it remained of her was an echo sound. Nemesis, the goddess of retribution and revenge, learned that had happened and decided to punish Narcissus for his behaviour. She led him to a pool. Here Narcissus lay down to drink. There, for the first time he saw his reflection in the water.<br><br>

							 &emsp;And while he slaked his thirst, another thirst<br>
							 &emsp;Grew; as he drank he saw before his eyes<br>
							 &emsp;A form, a face, and loved with leaping heart<br>
							 &emsp;A hope unreal, and thought the shape was real <br><br>

						He fell in love for the first time in his life, not realising it was merely an image. But when he reached down to caress the beautiful youth in the pool, the object of his love broke away. Unable to leave the beauty of his own reflection. He stared at his own reflection until he died. Narcissus’ name lives on as the flower into which he was transformed and as a synonym for those obsessed with their own appearance.<br>
						 &emsp;McLuhan also suggests that Narcissus did not fall in love with himself but instead he was in love with the extension of himself. Numb to his image, he could not recognize the reflection as his own. He proposes through this extension, humans become a closed system, so numb that they can’t even recognise themselves on for instance modern social media platforms. We are unaware that we are looking at ourselves because we become numb to our self-portraits and produce many different versions of ourselves. McLuhan continues, the act of viewing your own selfie generates a feeling of numbness because it provides a sort of relief from stress or any personal anxiety. It is through the self-application or offload that we get a break from reality and thus the satisfaction is derived from capturing and viewing selfies, not within ourselves.  “To behold or use any extension of ourselves in technological form is necessarily to embrace it… It is continuous embrace of our own technology in daily use that puts us in the Narcissus role of subliminal awareness and numbness in relation to these images of ourselves. The narcissistic element lies around the fact that it is an obsession with the physical or emotional extension of ourselves. The extended versions of ourselves that we create become live models of self-reflection. Although Narcissus spent his life looking at himself, he never released a copy of his image. His image only existed there at that moment. The reflection is the water has limitations, he paid a price for feeling artificially limitless. Since Instagram travels with us, we have more opportunities than Narcissus had to become fascinated by our image.<br>
							 &emsp;Being aware of the self is not as normal as it may seem. A very few other animals, mostly other primate, are able to pass the so called: MSR test or mirror test. The test is a behavioural technique developed in 1970 as an attempt to determine whether an animal possesses the ability of visual self-recognition. Very few species have passed the MSR test. As of 2016, only great apes (including humans), a single Asiatic elephant, dolphins, orcas and the Eurasian magpie have passed the test. Even children from the age of 18 months start to develop self-recognition.  It seems obvious to most of us that the ability to construct or develop a self is dependent on our brains that has evolved and on the unique human capacity for language. The set of rules that allows us to combine and re-combine thousands of words, to generate new sentences, thoughts and ideas. There is no doubt other vocabularies of images, sounds and movement also come into play. As far as we know, no other animals share this generative capacity. Maybe that’s the reason why not dogs but humans are the ones taking the selfies. <br><br>

						 &emsp;Czech media theorist Vilém Flusser, in his book Toward a Philosophy of Photography, observes that photographers use the camera in an ‘attempt to find the possibilities not yet discovered within it’.03 As though he foresaw the appeal of Instagram, Flusser’s writings elucidate the image capture practices of many people. <br><br><br>


						The surroundings<br>
						Selfies don’t only illustrate an expression of the self, they are also characterized by the relationship to the space around them. The surroundings can tell a lot about a person. The selfie is also about the placement of the self in a place at a time. Although selfies are most frequently taken in a rather private setting, they are also made in place that are public. When a selfie is taken in private setting, they become publicized private. In public, a selfie records a personal moment that is shared, with people who are not necessarily physically present. The image can also become too authentic, for instance when the person has included something too personal. The device serves as a filter not only through its use of software to alter an image but also in the ways that if it frames and removes elements of the surroundings through the physical relationship of the hand, the device, the body and the surroundings.<br>
						 &emsp;Recently a new bizarre, flaunt your wealth challenge trend was generated, photos of people lying face down on the ground, surrounded by luxury bags, shoes and sometimes stacks of cash. Over a million posts were uploaded on Chinese social platforms in just two weeks. Dressed up in their finery, the influencers usually pose like they just fallen out of their luxury car and spilled their most valuable and luxury possessions on the ground worth thousands of dollars. This trend is taking selfies to a whole new level. <br>

						Filters, the perfect you?<br>
						Mirrors allowed us to see our own reflection, but not to record it. Cameras allowed us to record our own image, but until the front-facing camera they did not allow use to see our face as we pressed the shutter. The front-facing camera is different from other reflective surfaces but has become our new, improved mobile mirrors. Manufactures keep improving the quality of the front-facing camera, for example by adding a flash option, to fulfil our desire to take a photo of our best self and share these photos. The first front camera was the iPhone 4, but the front camera was never invented for selfies. When Steve Jobs revealed the iPhone 4, he demonstrated the new camera’s intended uses by making the first FaceTime call. In 2015, Apple formally acknowledged how much users used the camera to take selfies by introducing a dedicated folder for selfies in Photos. For the first time, selfie lovers’ vanity was quantified and tagged. But the world was not ready for such an honest mirror. Among the most google queries for iOS9 was, “How do I delete the selfie folder?” The camera does not only reflect the self it also adjusts the image. Photo manipulation is not something new. But also a mirror does not always portray reality. This is also something that comes back in many fairy tale stories. For instance, in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In the fairy tale the evil Queen utters the famous line “Mirror, mirror, on the wall – who is the fairest one of all?”. The reflection of the self plays an important role. The evil Queen wants the mirror to show her that she is the fairest of them all.<br>  
							 &emsp;In The Mirror of Matsuyama the mirror isn’t actually magic but its owner thinks it is. Her dying mother gives her the mirror and tells her whenever she looks in it, she will remember her. As the girl grows up, she looks in the mirror and because she resembles her mother, she thinks the dead mother is there with her. Just like Narcissus she becomes numb to the image and fails to recognize herself in it. Also in Beauty and the Beast the mirror plays an important role. It possesses magical abilities, allowing its user to see anything he or she whishes’ to see. Comparable to Instagram filters giving us the possibility to capture and see the most ‘perfect’ version of ourselves.<br><br> 

						Ever since the first camera was invented photo manipulation was too. Even self-portraits are manipulated by the painter’s view and interpretation. But with today’s Instagram filters photo manipulation became normal and easy, an everyday activity for many people. When you upload a photo to Instagram you click through a screen that asks you whether you want to filter it, crop it or decorate it. You can choose from 42 different filters. Selfies are a way of expressing yourself to family, friends and total strangers too. Whether you embrace this image is your own decision. People don’t just upload their photo as it is. On Instagram for instance there are many different filter to change the look of the image. Some give the photo just a little bit more contrast but some give you bunny ears, some make your mouth super huge, there are even filters that make your skin a bit smoother and whiter, and your eyes a bit bigger. I remember my first mobile camera (on my LadyPhone) filters where just still images on top of the photo. You had to fit and adjust to the filter. But with the growth of technologies this has changed completely. The filter now adapts to your face and environment. According to dictionary.com the definition of the word filter is: “something that works like a filter, as by removing, blocking, or separating out certain elements”. In 2014, the OED published a draft definition of the word filter as used in computing: “To process or reformat (data) using a filter especially so as to remove unwanted content.”. In both definitions of the word filter, removing is mentioned. Instagram filters may in fact remove data, for instance by making a colour image black and white, but often the filter is added to the image, not removed. The filters are used to add, enlarge or exaggerate. Maybe the photo filter is so interesting to us because they show images that look different than the world we are used to seeing around us every day. The filtered image shows us ourselves, and our surroundings, with the eye of a machine, almost like we get to see our lives through the eyes of someone else. Putting a filter on our selfies gives it a distance that makes them new to us. We see ourselves and our surroundings as if we are outside of ourselves. <br>

						Many people are encouraged to rely upon the post-production process rather than the initial capture process itself. Instagram filters radically change the lighting, color, and contrast of the image, which alters the meaning of the original image. Flusser’s essay ‘The Codified World’ illuminates the challenges of interpreting the filter function, as he explained, ‘we are programmed by colors’.51 He notes that colors surround us and communicate messages to us, such as the red and green traffic light signals that instruct us to stop or go.52 Moreover, he explains, ‘if a significant number of the messages programmed for us appear in color, it means that surfaces have become important as carriers of messages’.53 It is possible that filtered images absorb unintended meanings from former, unrelated epochs of photography by borrowing their color palettes. Certain filters imitate physical signifiers of age by generating digitized dust, fading or scratch marks on top of images.54 These types of effects replicate the physicality of old photographs and convince users that their filtered images have earned the weight of time.55 This instant faux gravitas implants visual signifiers from photography’s history into contemporary images but creates no dialogue with the past. The filter function repurposes the past to encourage users to generate digital praise about other users’ images in the present. People generally use the filter function to adorn an image with intense or desaturated color, and it seems as though they do not use the filter function to reference a moment in history but only borrow an older photograph’s aesthetic appeal. Without further examination, the messages that filters embed into our images will accumulate, and it will become impossible to decipher them. If ‘photographs remain undecoded’, Flusser warned, ‘they accomplish their task perfectly: programming society to act as though under a magic spell for the benefit of cameras’.56 Those who compulsively produce selfies seem to have fallen under this spell and search for an ideal self by combining images of themselves with various filters that mimic film photography’s appearance. It is as if they look for the perfect self in each decade of the 20th century.<br>
						 &emsp;Perhaps we are afraid that our images – our selves – will run out and therefore we produce selfies in excess. Precisely this type of activity is cause for concern. If ‘photographs remain undecoded’, Flusser warned, ‘they accomplish their task perfectly: programming society to act as though under a magic spell for the benefit of cameras’.05 For example, one can witness the power of this spell upon society in several YouTube tutorial videos titled ‘How to Take a Selfie’. In one of these tutorials, make-up artist Michelle Phan demonstrates how to ‘capture the best version of yourself’ and explains how to light your selfie, hold your smartphone, position your arm, hold your neck, find your best angle, study your face, and look ‘cuter’.06 As she revolves her smartphone around herself in this video, Phan appears to engage with her screen as if it were more than a machine as it captivates her attention. Perhaps, our preoccupation with Instagram is simple: it offers us infinite versions of ourselves, as though each picture promises a better version. <br><br>

						 &emsp;Similar to Flusser’s observation about photographers – ‘they do not want to change the world, but they are in search of information’13 – we seem to be in search of information about ourselves via our selfies.<br><br>

						 &emsp;Unfiltered selfies can also be too revealing and raw, too honest. With a filter, most people filter things they don’t like about themselves, their imperfections. All we want others to see are our most perfect version. We could say that Instagram isn’t about reality, it’s about a well-crafted fantasy. A photo ablum with all our highlights that show off versions of ourselves that you do want to remember and put on display for other people to admire and browse through. That’s why most of the photographs uploaded to Instagram are the most beautiful and entertaining moments of life. We show ourselves through the digital world different from who we really are. I used to airbrush my acne the moment I learned how to use Photoshop. I didn’t want people that wouldn’t see me in real life to know I was struggling with acne. I had the tools to create a better version of me, why not use the tool then? But it also made it more difficult for me to meet new people, what if they notice? I started to become jealous of this perfect digital version of myself. <br>
							 &emsp;Filters are creating a delusion in everyday life. The filters available to users are invisible to viewers. We become much more self-conscious about our appearance. There is a need to advertise ourselves. Social media is becoming a platform for people to reinvent themselves. It is allowing users to present themselves in the best manner possible to increase their ‘attractiveness’. What you see in a photo is never pure reality. With the help of social media sites, insecurities become perfections. Photo manipulation is now very much a formality. For some reason, they make people feel more confident with their appearance and their body image. Filtered pictures make them feel more powerful over the way people see them, attractive and unstoppable. Why do we always have to be the most beautiful of them all? <br>
						 &emsp;In Through the Looking Glass the mirror also plays an important role, through the mirror Alice enters a fantastical world. There she finds that, just like a reflection, everything is reversed, including logic. In 2017, the Chinese app Meitu was introduced. A photo-editing app, a terrifying force of photo technology. It is comparable to the Japanese purikura photo booths, but Meitu also works on your phone. It’s like Instagram is on steroids. The app offers a few general retouching and editing tools but to make things even worse there is the hand-drawn option. There are different features including the one that will give you a white-wash… The app automatically enlargers your eyes, narrows your face, puts a sparkle in your eyes and smooths out your skin. It also lets you instantly add an anime blush. On the website is says the app was installed 1.5 billion times, as well as 350 million active monthly users all around the world. But actually the app does much more than just providing a nice filter to make you look ‘better’. Many security experts are warning that the free app comes with a hefty trade-off. The app harvest your personal data and spies on their users this includes users’ IMEIs, phone numbers and GPS coordinates. To become this beautiful self, we have to give up our privacy.

						 &emsp;Not only does the app make you look like a completely different person, many people want to become this person. According to a 2017 poll, 55 percent of facial plastic surgeons reported seeing patients who wanted surgeries to help them look better in selfies, up from 13 percent in 2016. Yes, that’s right. People are now getting plastic surgery done to change the way they look on selfies… Research has shown that when the lens is very close to the face it makes the nose look about 30% larger compared to the rest of the face. Your nose is nearer to the camera relative to the rest of your face, and therefore look larger. Only at a distance of 1,5 meters the proportion of features is to real-life scale. If all the pictures you take from yourself are up close, the way you view yourself may be distorted. Selfies are skewing the way we think we look. MORE ABOUT SNAPCHAT DYSPHORIA.

						 &emsp;- The Red Shoes<br>
						 &emsp;A peasant girl named Karen is adopted by a rich old lady after her mother’s death and grows up vain and spoiled. She wears the shoes all the time although the old lady tells her not to do. One day, after her adoptive mother becomes ill, Karen leaves her alone and goes off to a ball in town in her red shoes. She begins to dance, but this time the shoes won’t come off. An angel appears to her, bearing a sword, and condemns her to dance even after she dies, as a warning to vain children everywhere. <br><br><br>

						#nofilter<br>
						The hashtag #nofilter us used when the user displays selfies without using digital filters. It is indicating that what you are seeing is exactly what they were seeing. The image presents authenticity or objective ‘reality’ beauty of a location or subject. The website Filter Fakers calls out cheaters who manipulate digital photographs through Instagram but claim the image is the original. By using the hashtag we want people to make sure people know no filter was used to make the image more beautiful. But why? Could you imagine a painter letting you know that their latest work was created without the use of a No. 6 fan brush, #nofanbrush.  MORE ABOUT #NOFILTER<br><br><br>

						Why we should have listened, probably…<br>
						In many religions, vanity, is considered a form of self-idolatry in which one likens oneself to the greatness of God for the sake of one’s own image. In Christian teachings, vanity is an example of pride, the most serious of the seven deadly sins. But also in the Bahai Faith, Baha’u’llah uses the term ‘vain imaginings’. Also Friederich Nietzsche wrote that “vanity is the fear of appearing original: it is thus a lack of pride, but not necessarily a lack of originality”.  <br>
						 &emsp;A 2018 study of news reports showed that between October 2011 to November 2017, 259 people died while taking a selfie and 137 incidents were reported globally. The study said that more than 72% of the deaths were men, and drowning was the most common cause of death. <br> </b>
